# üê≥ Suibase Docker

Containerized environment for developing and testing Sui blockchain applications.

It provides a local Sui network and local explorer to develop and test your Sui blockchain apps.

## ü§î Motivation

Developing and testing Sui blockchain applications can be complex, requiring a local network setup, explorer, and various tools. Suibase Docker simplifies this process by providing a containerized environment that's easy to set up and use. It allows developers to focus on building their applications rather than managing infrastructure, making Sui development more accessible and efficient.
